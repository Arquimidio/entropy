        I love that coding exists, that i'm able to whisper to the metal's cold
        heart and make it talk back

        I'm always studying and practicing full stack development at work and by
        myself, recently also started to learn about system design so i can
        build some nice bridges

        I'm currently based in Brazil, where the only most satisfying thing than
        samba is crafting functional code
