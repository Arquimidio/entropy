Since joining programming communities, i've noticed a common pattern between programming students. When many students find errors with their code or tricky bugs, their first move is often to ask someone else to take a look at their code. There’s nothing wrong with seeking help, but learning programming requires effort, and understanding the problems you face is a huge part of it. Sometimes you will find yourself working on a company and will need to debug ancient code from someone who left years ago. 

What happens when a programmer relies solely on external help? Do they try to contact the ex-employee on LinkedIn, or just sit and cry?

### General Approaches for Problem Solving

There there isn't a one-size-fits-all process as lots of factors depend on the context, but following these general approaches should make it easier to identify exactly where is the problem.

- *Actually read the error message*: this one is pretty obvious, the errors are usually very informative regarding what has happened and can give you a good grasp on what to change to fix the issue (not always, but this is the very first step).

- *Use a debugger*: with a debugger it's much easier to track down the piece of code that has problems. It gives you an overview of the values that are being stored in each variable and also being passed to function, everything in runtime. While using logs can help solidify your understanding during the learning process (my personal experience, no scientific confirmation here), debuggers become essential as the software grows in complexity.

-* Divide and Conquer*: go there and start ripping out your code's guts piece by piece, then execute it to see what have changed.
When you do this, you narrow down the possible parts of the code were the problem. You might get new errors, but lots of times in the life of a programmer, getting a different error message is considered progress.

### Ask Questions at the Right Time

The moment you face a problem you never faced before, is your first instinct to ask others for help? Before borrowing someone else's time and perspective, consider: what have you already tried?

Have you:

- *Reflected on the problem and approached it from different angles* - Your brain is not a straight line, it's made of curves.
- *Googled it* - Chances are someone already faced the exact same problem.
- *Asked ChatGPT* - It usually has the answer to common problems and is able to explain it.
- *Framed a clear and concise question* - Many times, the problem lies in your own assumptions.

If you couldn't find the solution after going through this process, that's probably a good moment to share this with someone else. At least now you have a better overview of the problem, you know what you have tried and didn't work. This saves time for both of you and significantly narrows down the problem.

I hate to sound like a "coach", but get out of your comfort zone. If you don't get used to try learning stuff by yourself before asking others for help, your growth will be much slower and dependent. How can you learn from your mistakes if you don't allow yourself to understand the mistake? No one is supposed to have an answer ready when a problem happens, lots of times it involves investigation, experimentation and logical reasoning

### Be curious about finding and understanding the solution

When you find a to your issue quick fix, do you simply accept it and move on? Well, you can, and a lot of people will, but that's a missed opportunity to understand why it works. Curiosity leads to deeper understanding, which over time will help you build long-term professional experience.

Approaching problems with curiosity turns them into a learning opportunity. Explore how things work, don't just accept "ready to eat information" and move on.

### No rules, just guidelines

I can't provide a one-size-fits-all approach since much of this depends on context, but at least having these general ideas might provide directions to follow when faced with a problem you initially don't know how to solve, allowing you to approach it in a smarter way.

It’s a common saying: “There’s no such thing as a dumb question.”. I agree, but some questions are a missed opportunity. You learn much more when you seek knowledge instead of just waiting for it to be served for you on a plate! Learning isn't just about getting the answer, there is pleasure in connecting the dots, learning can be fun!

Before asking others, ask yourself. Question your assumptions, experiment and enjoy the learning process!
