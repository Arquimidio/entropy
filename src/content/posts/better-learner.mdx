description: The Attitudes That Elevates Programmers
---

Since joining programming communities, i've noticed a common pattern between programming students. When they encounter errors with their code or tricky bugs, their first move is often to ask someone else to take a look at their code. There’s nothing wrong with seeking help, but learning programming requires effort, and understanding the problems you face is a huge part of it. Sometimes you will find yourself working on a company and will need to debug ancient code from someone who left years ago. 

So, what will a programmer who relies on external help do? Try to reach the ex-employee on LinkedIn? Sit and cry?

## Ask questions at the right time

The moment you face a problem you never faced before, is your first instinct to ask others for help? Before borrowing someone else's time and perspective, consider: what have you already tried?

Have you:

- Reflected on the problem and approached it from different angles. Your brain is not a straight line, it's made of curves.
- Googled it. Chances are someone already faced the exact same problem.
- Asked ChatGPT. It usually has the answer to common problems and is able to explain it.
- Framed a clear and concise question. Many times, the problem lies in your own assumptions.

If you couldn't find the solution after going through this process, that's a good moment to share this with someone else. At least now you have a better overview of the problem, you know what you have tried and didn't work. This saves time for both of you and significantly narrows down the problem.

I hate to sound like a "coach", but get out of your comfort zone. If you don't get used to try learning stuff by yourself before asking others for help, your growth will be much slower and dependent

## Be curious about finding and understanding the solution

Let's say someone gives you a quick fix for a problem. Do you just accept it and move on? Well, you can, and a lot of people will. But that's a missed opportunity to understand why it works. Curiosity leads to deeper understanding, which over time will help you build long-term professional experience.

Approaching problems with curiosity turns them into a learning opportunity. Explore how things work, don't just accept "ready to eat information" and move on.

## No rules, just guidelines

I can't provide a one-size-fits-all approach since much of this depends on context, but at least having these general ideas might provide directions to follow when faced with a problem you initially don't know how to solve, allowing you to approach it in a smarter way.

It’s a common saying: “There’s no such thing as a dumb question.”. I agree, but some questions are a missed opportunity. You learn much more when you seek knowledge instead of just waiting for it to be served for you on a plate! Learning isn't just about getting the answer, there is pleasure in connecting the dots, it can fun

Before asking others, ask yourself. Question your assumptions, experiment and enjoy the learning process!
